# Clicked-Sprint-Incident-Response-and-Review
This is a Mini Sprint hosted by Clicked. The project content was a collaboration of 2 members.

## Scenario
Maven Clinic, a file transfer platform, recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network.

As a security analyst, your task is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review.

You will be working closely with Gemma Chan, CTO.

You are given 2 data sets:
- Logs
- IP addresses noted making a connection on or around the time of the unusual activity

## Learning Objectives
- Master the steps of the NIST Incident Response Process Framework
- Develop hands-on expertise in effectively responding to and mitigating security threats
- Learn to determine the proper audience for your incident review based on the severity of the incident
- Sharpen your communication skills to brief the target audience

## Content
- **Bulk IP Lookup Results:** Excel of locations of IPs noted during unusual activity
- **Identification and Findings:** Documentation of findings from determining the scope and magnitude of the incident then categorizing its nature
- **Response, Containment and Eradication:** Presentation of recommended containment plan that includes short-term and long-term implementations
- **Post Incident Review:** Presentation of a post-incident review designed to refine procedures and prepare for potential future incidents
